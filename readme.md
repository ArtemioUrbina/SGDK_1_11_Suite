SGDK 1.11 for the Genesis/MD 240p Test Suite
===============================================================================

Main Branch/current SGDK at: https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK

This has been uploaded as a snapshot from SGDK in 2014, only changes are
to the joystick and adding the linker scripts for Sega CD.

This has not been updated due to size, since targeting the Sega CD gas been
a priority.
